## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Intercept, vehicle_length and ground_clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Each of their probability values are lower than our significance level of .05.  In other words, vehicle_length and ground_clearance have a significant impact on MPG. 
* The slope of this regression is not 0 because there is a significant between our dependent and independent variables. 
* This linear regression model tells us there is a relationship between a few of the metrics for cars (vehicle_length and ground_clearance) and mpg. This tells how our independent variables account for variability in our depdent variable. However, this does not predict the mpg of the MechaChar protoypes.
